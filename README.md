# ShadowSMS
Shadow SMS is a small bash script that using the API -textbalt- allows us to send SMS to any phone number in any country anonymously and totally untraceable.
The use of a TOR router is recommended to secure 100% outbound traffic, although it is not necessary.

TextBalt allows us to send a totally free daily message, in case we want to send more through its website we can acquire more messages and enter our key in the script.

I have developed this tool with an educational nature, I am not responsible for any possible misuse that it may be given.

This tool can be used both in a Linux desktop environment and in Termux (Android).
