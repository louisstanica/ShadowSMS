# ShadowSMS
This is a small bash script that I have written today that allows us to send SMS to any number anonymously, it uses the "textbal" API that allows us to send a free SMS per day, it is 100% anonymous and if we use a router to direct our traffic through tor, the use of the person who wants to use this tool will be totally undetectable.

Valid both for desktop linux environment and for Termux without root.
